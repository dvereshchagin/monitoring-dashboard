# CloudWatch Integration Configuration Example

# Enable/Disable CloudWatch Features
CLOUDWATCH_METRICS_ENABLED=true
CLOUDWATCH_LOGS_ENABLED=true

# AWS Credentials (Required)
# For production, use IAM roles instead of static credentials
CLOUDWATCH_REGION=us-east-1
CLOUDWATCH_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
CLOUDWATCH_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key

# Optional: Override endpoint for LocalStack testing
# CLOUDWATCH_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4566

# Metrics Configuration
CLOUDWATCH_METRICS_NAMESPACE=MonitoringDashboard/System
CLOUDWATCH_METRICS_BUFFER_SIZE=100
CLOUDWATCH_METRICS_FLUSH_INTERVAL=10s
CLOUDWATCH_METRICS_STORAGE_RESOLUTION=60

# Metrics Dimensions (comma-separated key=value pairs)
# These dimensions will be added to all published metrics
CLOUDWATCH_METRICS_DIMENSIONS=Environment=production,Host=server-01,Region=us-east-1

# Logs Configuration
CLOUDWATCH_LOG_GROUP=/aws/monitoring-dashboard
CLOUDWATCH_LOG_STREAM=application
CLOUDWATCH_LOGS_BUFFER_SIZE=50
CLOUDWATCH_LOGS_FLUSH_INTERVAL=5s

# ---
# Note: All CloudWatch settings are optional and have sensible defaults.
# Only CLOUDWATCH_*_ENABLED and AWS credentials are required to enable the features.

# Cost Optimization Tips:
# 1. Use standard resolution (60s) instead of high resolution (1s) to reduce costs
# 2. Increase buffer sizes to reduce API calls
# 3. Increase flush intervals (within acceptable latency) to batch more data
# 4. Use dimensions strategically - each unique dimension combination creates a new metric
